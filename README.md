## Description

Schnitzelrally is an app with which you can create and plan a scavenger hunt alias Schnitzeljagd together with others online and then carry it out in the real wilderness.
Everyone who participates in the same route can create tasks and place them on the map and so link them to the real space with GPS coordinates.
Tasks can be multiple-choice questions, a task formulated in text for the whole team, a quiz question or photo upload.
Similar to geocaching but wilder!
